## Install via `pip`

---

## Install as `rpm`

We plan to build a Nester `rpm` package.

---

## Build from source

Nester uses `setuptools` as its build tool and `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` as configuration files. To install the requirements for Nester, you can use `pip` as follows:

1. Change to the Nester directory:

```shell
cd nester
```

2. Install the dependencies listed in `setup.cfg` using `pip`:

```shell
pip install -e .
```

This should install all necessary requirements for nester aswell as nester itself.

You can try it out now by calling

```shell
nester -h
```

>Note: If you encounter any issues with dependencies or installation, please refer to the troubleshooting section or reach out for help in the issues section or via email.
